        <!--ebb: When pointing to images in your own repo, always use *relative* file associations: Here we are pointing to an images directory that's in the same
        folder as this HTML file we're editing. And we're going into the images folder to deliver the newt-mosaic4.png file inside. -->
        <p>The above image is composed of several things</p>

            <li>A Building</li>
